## Main Discription
Deep Overworld is a mod that adds deepslate to the surface of the overworld! It does that thru a biome called the _"Deep Forest"_. The deep forest also has _"Deep Trees"_ that contain wood similar to warped wood but with a purple outside. The deep trees contain a wierd block that acts like the leves of the tree called _"Decayed Grasin"_. No one really knows what it is, at least for now... The biome doesn't have grass, instead, it has deepslate grass. Deepslate grass is deepslate covered in crucnchy moss that is similar to grass.
That's all for now, more comming soon!
